# SimpleCRUDJavaEntAPP
The application allows the user to view and modify the data even after closing and reopening the application. The information is stored in a text file for each data class used (`Trainer`, `Client`, `Manager`). The implementation details are up to the developer as long as CRUD operations and file read/write operations work properly.
