# Fitness Center Management Application

This is a desktop application built in Java for managing fitness center data. The application implements 3 windows for information registration and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) using 3 distinct data classes. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following packages:
- `model`: contains the data classes (`Trainer`, `Client`, `Manager`) and the parent class `User`.
- `view`: contains the main class and the 3 windows for data management.
- `controller`: contains the `FileController` interface with the attributes `File archive` and `boolean modified`, and the methods `boolean read()` and `boolean write()`. It also contains the `TextFileController` class that extends `FileController`.
- `resources`: contains the text files generated by the application (`clients.txt`, `managers.txt`, `trainers.txt`).
- `DTO.mappers`: contains the enums for `EGender`, `EPaymentMethod`, and `ERole`.

## File Management

The application allows the user to view and modify the data even after closing and reopening the application. The information is stored in a text file for each data class used (`Trainer`, `Client`, `Manager`). The implementation details are up to the developer as long as CRUD operations and file read/write operations work properly.
